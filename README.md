# Task 13: API Security Testing & Validation

**Intern Name:** Mohammed Fadil PK
**Date:** February 6, 2026

## 📄 Project Description
This project focuses on **Web Application Security**. I used **Postman** to interact with and test REST APIs. The goal was to understand HTTP methods (GET/POST) and simulate common API attacks like BOLA and Data Injection.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Postman:** For crafting and sending raw HTTP requests.
* **JSONPlaceholder:** A free fake API for testing and prototyping.

## 🔍 Key Activities
1.  **API Enumeration:** Sent `GET` requests to retrieve user data and tested for Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) by iterating IDs.
2.  **Data Injection:** Sent `POST` requests with custom JSON payloads to test input validation and server responses (`201 Created`).
3.  **Analysis:** Mapped findings to OWASP API Security Top 10 risks.

## 📂 Files Included
* `Task13_API_Security_Report.pdf` - Full documentation with screenshots.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
All testing was performed on `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`, which is a public API specifically designed for testing and learning.
